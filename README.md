- [Part 1 in Python: `sugarraysam/coderpro-py`](https://github.com/sugarraysam/coderpro-py).
- [Part 2 in C++: `sugarraysam/coderpro-cpp`](https://github.com/sugarraysam/coderpro-cpp).

I provided a complexity analysis of both memory and time for every solution. I am not sharing the problems as this is a proprietary product.
